# Student Performance Predictor

This is a beginner-friendly Machine Learning project that predicts whether a student will **pass or fail** based on their study habits, attendance, and other factors.

# Project Description

Using a **Decision Tree Classifier**, this model takes inputs like:
- Hours Studied
- Attendance Percentage
- Previous Exam Score
- Sleep Hours
- Internet Usage

...and predicts if the student is likely to pass.

# Technologies Used

- Python
- Pandas
- scikit-learn
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- Google Colab

# Sample Visualization

Graphs included:
- Hours Studied vs Result
- Attendance vs Result
- Heatmap of feature correlation

# Model Performance

- Model: Decision Tree Classifier
- Accuracy: 100% (on small sample test data)

# How to Run This Project

1. Download the `.ipynb` file from this repo
2. Open [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com)
3. Upload the notebook
4. Run all cells to see predictions and visualizations

# Dataset Info

Small sample dataset created manually inside the notebook (can be replaced with real data later).

# Future Improvements

- Use a larger, real-world dataset
- Try different ML algorithms (Random Forest, Logistic Regression)
- Improve accuracy with tuning and feature engineering
